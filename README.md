# Breakout-Game
Repository for a sample Unity game I built off of Imphenzia's YouTube channel.

GOAL:
Create a fun game where players need to bounce a ball at a group of cubes in order to break them and advance to the next level. 

HOW TO PLAY:
Press the play button to begin. The first level is a sample level. It passes by quick. Next is the second level, in which you must use a pad (controlled by sliding your mouse left to right) in order to bounce the ball. Destroying all the cubes with the ball takes you to the next level. Once you lose all 3 balls, your game is over. 

TIME TO BUILD:
About 6-8 hours. I tried going as slow as possible through the tutorial to understand the different mechanics of the game. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
How to write a C# script, how to import assets, how to use Blender, how to use Unity and its UI, using a GameManager, using system memory to track a high score, game physics, prefab creation, and more.
